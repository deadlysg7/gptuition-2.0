GPTuition

Welcome to GPTuition, an innovative application designed to enhance your learning experience. Our platform provides a range of powerful features, including:

- PDF Generation: Easily create professional-grade PDFs.
- Note Extraction: Extract concise and relevant notes directly from PDFs and YouTube lectures.
- Quiz Generation: Generate quiz questions tailored to the user’s grade level and chosen subject.

Official Plugins

Currently, GPTuition utilises two official plugins for React integration:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): This plugin leverages [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to provide Fast Refresh capabilities, ensuring a smooth development experience with instant updates during code changes.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): This alternative plugin utilises [SWC](https://swc.rs/), a fast and modern JavaScript/TypeScript compiler, for enabling Fast Refresh, providing enhanced performance during the development process.

## Application Capabilities

1. PDF Generation: Users can generate high-quality PDFs from various content sources, streamlining the process of document creation.
  
2. Note Extraction: The application can extract key points and summarised notes from uploaded PDFs or YouTube lecture videos, aiding users in their study and review processes.
  
3. Quiz Question Generation: Based on the user’s grade level and selected subject, the application generates relevant quiz questions, enabling effective self-assessment and revision.

We hope GPTuition serves as a valuable tool in your educational journey. For more information or to contribute to the project, please refer to the documentation or visit our repository.
